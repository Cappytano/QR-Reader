# QR-Reader â€” v7.1.5 (Core only)

This package includes only the app code. You must add the `/vendor` libraries yourself (ZXing-WASM, jsQR, Tesseract, SheetJS).

Run locally:
```
npm i
npm start   # http://localhost:8080
```

Deploy to GitHub Pages by committing this folder (plus `/vendor`) to your repo and enabling Pages.
