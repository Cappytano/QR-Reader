QR Logger â€” v5.3 (Scale + Delay + Photo + ZIP export)
====================================================
- Adjustable delay capture: weight + photo after each QR scan.
- Weight via OCR, USB/HID (WebHID), or Bluetooth (Weight Scale Service 0x181D or Nordic UART).
- Export options: Excel, CSV, and **ZIP (CSV + photos)**. Photos are saved into /photos and the CSV references their filenames.
- Deployed as a PWA; works offline after first load.

Tips
----
- HTTPS is required for camera, WebHID, and WebBluetooth.
- OCR needs good contrast; position the OCR box over the scale digits.
